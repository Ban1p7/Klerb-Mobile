# klerb-clone-java
A klerb clone in java using libGDX

#### [My itch page](https://nebjs.itch.io)
#### [Original klerb](https://nebjs.itch.io/klerb)
#### [Klerb 2](https://nebjs.itch.io/klerb2)

Note: this game is not the same as those ones, and uses different assets etc. The only similarities are the name and the gameplay, as I just needed some really simple idea to test out libGDX for the first time, and thought this was a good one. I just happened to open source it, don't worry about it. This isn't an official game in the series (yet), and it just a test/learning experience.

## Quick description
I feel I don't really need to be more descriptive than that. You can play it, I guess. Just run `git clone https://github.com/Ban1p7/klerb-clone-java.git` then navigate there in your browser and run `./gradlew desktop:run`. Or do something similar with the gradle.bat file if you're on Windows, I've never used it and just kept it in for compatability. You do need to have a version of a JDK installed for it to work, I'm on Java 21.0.3 2024-04-16 LTS, but others probably work too. Uhh, yeah. That's about it.


## How to build
Use gradle.

### Linux
```
git clone https://github.com/Ban1p7/klerb-clone-java.git
cd klerb-clone-java
chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew desktop:run
```
### Windows
On windows I'd assume it's the following, but I don't really have any idea.
```
git clone https://github.com/Ban1p7/klerb-clone-java.git
cd klerb-clone-java
./gradle.bat desktop:run
```
### MacOS
No idea
### FreeBSD
I should've stopped listing operating systems, I have no idea
### Anything else
Go to [the libGDX site](https://libgdx.com) and figure it out on your own. I believe in you.


## License
Whatever license is in the LICENSE file is my license for all the code that I've made, but the gradlew and gradlew.bat and build.gradle files might have their own licenses (?), I just generated it all from the [libGDX project creator](https://libgdx.com). SO yeah. That's the licensing.


## Can you contribute?
Nope. You can fork it, if you want for some reason, or you can contribute image/sound effects/music assets, that sort of thing, but because I'm making this for fun, I'm not accepting code contributions. Not that I'd imagine anyone wants to make my game for me anyway, since anyone with that ability would surely just make their own game, because if an idiot like me can do it, it'd be a piece of cake for anyone else. And this is just a clone of a game anyway, not even the originak, I should probably specify that.
